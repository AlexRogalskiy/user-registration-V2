Sample Java Project with Chef
=============================

[German / Deutsch](LIESMICH.md)

This is a sample to show how Chef can be used to configure a Java environment.

The Vagrantfile can be used to provision the Java application on a
virtual machine managed by VirtualBox. See http://vagrantup.com/
. To see the application running just use:
`vagrant up`

Another possibility is to provision the application using chef
solo. The script `install.sh` does that.

The web application is located in `cookbooks/webapp/files/default` .

Look at roles/tomcatserver.json to figure out which recipes are run
and how they are customized. The cookbooks are taken from the
Opscode's Open Source repository.

The directory `.chef` contains a simple `knife.rb` that must be adjusted
to be used with knife. Then the application can be installed in the
Amazon EC2 cloud.

To use it:
* Install Knife - see http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html
* Install the EC2 plug in - see
  http://docs.opscode.com/plugin_knife_ec2.html
* Upload the cookbooks using  `knife cookbook upload â€“a`
* Upload the role with `knife role from file roles/tomcatserver.json`
* Now create a new server with   `knife ec2 server create -r
  'role[tomcatserver]' -i .chef/AmazonPEM.pem -r 'role[tomcatserver]'`
